#after getting the corrolations, we need to check the corrolation of the individual features with each other, Namely independent variables needs to be uncorrelated with each other 
#we can drop one if the corrolation is high 

#example code:
print(df[["X1","X2"]].corr()) 
# keep the one that has the higest corr with the target valuable
